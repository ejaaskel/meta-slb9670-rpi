# Load the kernel to ramdisk address. We do not have a ramdisk in our image
# so the address can be used, and we are assumed to be using fitImage. This
# is required because we extract the kernel from fitImage to address
# 0x00008000. If we load the fitImage to the kernel_addr_r at 0x00080000 as
# is done usually extracting kernel will overwrite the fitImage and cause
# the kernel extraction to fail
